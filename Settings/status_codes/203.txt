Response 203 - Non-Authoritative Information [Successful Response]
```This response code means the returned meta-information is not exactly the same as is available from the origin server, but is collected from a local or a third-party copy. This is mostly used for mirrors or backups of another resource. Except for that specific case, the "200 OK" response is preferred to this status.
